   If tone is mid: balanced encouragement + one concrete improvement tip.
   If tone is high: strong praise + one small tip or reinforcement.

3) End with a motivating next step (what to do next).

- Use simple words a {student_age} year old understands
- Do not repeat or name the specific practice words/letters in your feedback (e.g., avoid saying the exact target word)
